# FUTURE_ML_01
#  Classify Spotify Songs by Mood   

## ** Project Description**  
This project aims to classify songs based on their mood (happy, sad, energetic, etc.) using **machine learning**.  
The classification is done based on audio features extracted from the dataset.  

## ** Dataset**  
We used the **Spotify Tracks Dataset** available on Kaggle:  
[Spotify Tracks Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maharshipandya/-spotify-tracks-dataset)  

## ** Libraries Used**  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data Handling)  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (Data Visualization)  
- **Librosa** (Audio Feature Extraction)  
- **Scikit-learn** (Machine Learning Model)  

## ** Approach**  
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned missing values, normalized features.  
2. **Feature Engineering**: Extracted important features like tempo, energy, loudness, and danceability.  
3. **Model Selection**: Used classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).  
4. **Evaluation**: Measured accuracy, precision, and recall to select the best model.  

## ** Results**  
- Achieved an **accuracy of 0.88%**.  
- Visualized mood distributions across different playlists.  

## ** How to Run**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Charanranga/FUTURE_ML_01.git
